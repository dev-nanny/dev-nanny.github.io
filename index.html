        <p>The Dev-Nanny project is aimed to make it trivial for developers to improve the
quality of the code they write, regardless of experience level.</p>

<p>This primary goal is supported by tools that offer education and enforcement.
As Dev-Nanny uses various tools to help her make suggestions or improvements, the
definition of "quality" can be defined by the programmer.</p>

<p>However, if a programmer finds it difficult to define "quality", dev-nanny will
make a suggestion there too.</p>

<p>This makes DevNanny ideally suited for both novice programmers as well as
seasoned professionals.</p>

<h2>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>Everything should work straight out of the box. DevNanny will be run each time
a developer does a <code>git commit</code>.</p>

<p>After the next release of Dev-nanny, it can also be run from the command-line using the binary placed in the
<code>vendor/bin</code> folder. The full command would be:</p>

<pre><code>./vendor/bin/dev-nanny
</code></pre>

<p>On each run, all included connectors will be run.</p>

<h2>
<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>Dev-Nanny needs to be installed per individual project using Composer.
Run the following command on the command-line inside your project folder:</p>

<pre><code>php composer.phar require dev-nanny/dev-nanny --dev
</code></pre>

<p>This will download everything Dev-Nanny needs and install the git hook.</p>

<h3>
<a id="available-connectors" class="anchor" href="#available-connectors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Available Connectors</h3>

<p>Connectors are available for the following tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>Php Lint (also known as <code>php -l</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Planned Connectors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Config Checker (compares config files of various services against DevNanny/Config
package and make suggestions for improvement)</li>
<li>Other Lints (js, css, yml, scss, xml, bash, etc.)</li>
<li>QA Tools (CodeSniffer, Copy/Paste Detector, Mess Detector, etc.)</li>
<li>Test Runners (PhpUnit, Behat, Codeception, PhpSpec, etc.)</li>

<h3>
<a id="packages" class="anchor" href="#packages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Packages</h3>

<p>This project has been divided into separate packages that each have a single,
distinct, responsibility. This is done to make it as easy as possible to alter,
overwrite or customise parts of DevNanny.</p>

<p>The chain of dependency is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>   Dev-Nanny/Dev-Nanny¹ ---&gt; Dev-Nanny/ComposerPlugin² ---&gt; Dev-Nanny/GitHook
                |
                `-&gt; Dev-Nanny/Connectors¹ ---&gt; Dev-Nanny/ConnectorBase
                                           `-&gt; Individual Connectors³
¹ = Meta Package
² = Composer Plugin
³ = Dev Nanny Connector
</code></pre>

<p>You will need to create an appropriate hook yourself. It will need to run
DevNanny against the received file list. (See the <em>Usage</em> section)</p>

<p>If you decide to create such a hook, please share the result so others may also
benefit from your efforts.</p>

<p>If creating a hook seems too complex or daunting, feel free to open an issue
requesting an example or full implementation.</p>

<p>If you don't use any versioning tool <em>ever</em> you may want to consider starting to
use one <em>now</em>. You are missing out on great things!</p>

<p>If you don't use a versioning tool for a certain project, you can always just
run dev-nanny occasionally by hand or use a file-watcher or task-runner to run
dev-nanny on an interval or whenever a file changes.</p>
